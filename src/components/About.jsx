        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        I am a passionate and dedicated developer with an
        eagerness to learn. My background in Economics and
        data science has equipped me with an analytical
        mindset and empirical research ability. I enjoy
        problem-solving when in a team as well as
        individually, and I am always ready for new
        challenges!</p>
